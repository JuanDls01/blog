        Hello, I&apos;m Juani De los Santos
      </h1>
      <span>
        I&apos;m a FullStack Software Engineer at Crombie.dev, where I build
        high-performing, robust, and high-traffic web applications using
        technologies like <Badge variant="outline">React</Badge>,{" "}
        <Badge variant="outline">Next.js</Badge> and{" "}
        <Badge variant="outline">TypeScript</Badge>. My constant curiosity and
        drive for new challenges keep me at the forefront of the latest
        technological advancements.

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I have worked on MVP projects for both internal
          and external clients, as well as on an e-commerce platform for one of
          the world&apos;s most renowned sports brands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond my work as a developer, I&apos;m an industrial engineering
          student on the verge of graduatingâ€”a background that has honed my
          ability to deconstruct complex problems into simpler, manageable
          parts. While this analytical approach has been invaluable in my
          career, the friendships I&apos;ve made along the way are what I
          cherish the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          I look forward to embracing new challenges and opportunities that
          drive innovation and foster continuous growth.
