# Advanced MDX Features Demo

This post demonstrates all the new advanced MDX features that have been implemented in this blog. These features make writing and reading technical content much more engaging and professional.

## Enhanced Code Blocks

The blog now supports proper syntax highlighting with various languages:

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
// Enhanced syntax highlighting with copy functionality
function calculateFibonacci(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  
  let a = 0, b = 1;
  for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    [a, b] = [b, a + b];
  }
  
  return b;
}

// Usage example
const result = calculateFibonacci(10);
console.log(`The 10th Fibonacci number is: ${result}`);
```

### TypeScript with React

```tsx
interface ButtonProps {
  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg';
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick?: () => void;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ 
  variant, 
  size = 'md', 
  children, 
  onClick 
}) => {
  const baseClasses = 'rounded-lg font-medium transition-colors';
  const variantClasses = {
    primary: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700',
    secondary: 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-300',
    danger: 'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700'
  };
  const sizeClasses = {
    sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',
    md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',
    lg: 'px-6 py-3 text-lg'
  };

  return (
    <button
      className={`${baseClasses} ${variantClasses[variant]} ${sizeClasses[size]}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};
```

### Python Example

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    """
    Efficient implementation of quicksort algorithm
    Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case
    Space Complexity: O(log n)
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

# Example usage
numbers = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
sorted_numbers = quick_sort(numbers)
print(f"Sorted array: {sorted_numbers}")
```

## Callout Components

The blog now supports various types of callouts for better content organization:

<Note>
This is a **note** callout. Use it for helpful information, tips, or additional context that supports the main content.
</Note>

<Tip>
This is a **tip** callout. Perfect for best practices, shortcuts, or pro tips that can help readers work more effectively.
</Tip>

<Warning>
This is a **warning** callout. Use it to highlight important caveats, potential issues, or things that require careful attention.
</Warning>

<Danger>
This is a **danger** callout. Reserve this for critical warnings about actions that could cause data loss, security issues, or breaking changes.
</Danger>

<Info>
This is an **info** callout. Great for providing additional context, related information, or explanations of concepts.
</Info>

<Success>
This is a **success** callout. Perfect for highlighting achievements, completed steps, or positive outcomes.
</Success>

## Enhanced Tables

Tables now have improved styling with proper borders, hover effects, and responsive design:

| Feature | Before | After | Impact |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Syntax Highlighting | Basic (sugar-high) | Advanced (Shiki) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Copy Functionality | None | Click to copy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Callout Components | None | 6 types available | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Table Styling | Basic | Enhanced with hover | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Math Support | None | KaTeX integration | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| TypeScript Support | Basic | Full type safety | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Inline Code

You can use inline code like `const greeting = "Hello World"` or reference functions like `useState()` and components like `<Button />` directly in your text.

## Enhanced Blockquotes

> This is an enhanced blockquote with improved styling. It now has a colored left border, subtle background, and better typography that makes quoted content stand out while remaining readable.
>
> Blockquotes can contain multiple paragraphs and even **formatted text** to emphasize important points from external sources.

## Code Blocks with Different Languages

### Bash/Terminal

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test
```

### SQL

```sql
-- Create a users table with proper indexing
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Create an index for faster email lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES 
    ('johndoe', 'john@example.com'),
    ('janedoe', 'jane@example.com');
```

### JSON Configuration

```json
{
  "name": "advanced-blog",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "description": "Blog with advanced MDX features",
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "canary",
    "react": "18.2.0",
    "shiki": "^3.12.0",
    "remark-gfm": "^4.0.1",
    "rehype-katex": "^7.0.1"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start"
  }
}
```

## Enhanced Lists

### Unordered Lists
- ✅ Enhanced syntax highlighting with Shiki
- ✅ Copy-to-clipboard functionality for code blocks
- ✅ Six different callout/alert component types
- ✅ Improved table styling with hover effects
- ✅ Better typography and spacing
- ✅ Full TypeScript support throughout

### Ordered Lists
1. **Plan**: Identify the features needed for better writing experience
2. **Design**: Create reusable components with proper TypeScript types
3. **Implement**: Build each feature with careful attention to performance
4. **Test**: Ensure everything works in both development and production
5. **Document**: Create comprehensive examples for future reference
6. **Deploy**: Make the enhanced features available to all blog posts

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions

<Info>
The implementation prioritizes **server-side compatibility** to ensure fast builds and good SEO performance. Client-side enhancements are layered on top without breaking the core functionality.
</Info>

Key architectural choices:
- **Server-first rendering**: All components work during static generation
- **Progressive enhancement**: Client-side features enhance but don't replace server functionality
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and minimal JavaScript bundle size

### Component Structure

```
src/components/
├── code.tsx          # Enhanced code blocks with copy functionality
├── callout.tsx       # Alert/callout components (6 types)
├── simple-code.tsx   # Server-compatible code highlighting
├── simple-mdx.tsx    # Main MDX processor with all features
├── table-of-contents.tsx  # TOC generation and scroll spy
└── toc-wrapper.tsx   # Client-side wrapper for TOC
```

## Future Enhancements

<Tip>
The modular architecture makes it easy to add more features like math equations, interactive components, or custom MDX plugins without affecting existing functionality.
</Tip>

Planned improvements:
- Math equation support with KaTeX (CSS already included)
- Interactive components for demos
- Mermaid diagram support
- Custom syntax highlighting themes
- Table of contents with scroll spy (currently disabled for build compatibility)

## Conclusion

These enhanced MDX features significantly improve both the writing and reading experience. Writers get powerful tools for creating engaging technical content, while readers benefit from better formatting, syntax highlighting, and information hierarchy.

<Success>
The blog now supports all major content formatting needs for technical writing, making it a powerful platform for sharing knowledge and tutorials.
</Success>
